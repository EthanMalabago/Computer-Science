hw10 - Due 10 November 2025

Write a program that declares a two-dimensional character array, a, of dimensions [5 x 10] (5 rows, 10 columns), populates the array with random capital letters, and outputs the array in the matrix format.

Functions should be used to populate the array and print. 

This means that we are going to use these functions:
random(seed)
fill_array()
print_array()

Output should look something like this if it were in format [3 x 5]:
A K P I B
A A B L O
C B C Z K
