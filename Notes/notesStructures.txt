STRUCTURES - first introduced on Monday, 10 November 2025
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYNTAX:

struct Point
{
    double x, y;
};

This is a structure. The key word to create a structure is called "struct". 
Note how the name of the structure is called "Point" with a capital starting letter.
That is the standard for naming classes in C++, alongside lowercase variables and
all-caps constants. 

This structure defines something called Point, which has two fields: x and y, both of which
take in double values.
