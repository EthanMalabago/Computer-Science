For a lot of these constants, more libraries are needed such as C math:
    <cmath>

Which is implemented like this:
    #include <cmath>

Some built-in constants
    - INT_MAX
    - INT_MIN
    - DBL_MAX
    - DBL_MIN
    - M_PI

How to use one for example:
    cout << INT_MAX << endl;

Square Root Function
    - sqrt(4) = 2.0
    The square root function is designed for a double output, even if there is an integer in the input

Power Function
    - pow(base, exponent)

Absolute Value Function
    - abs(x)
    - fabs(x)
        specifically for real numbers

Natural Log Function
    - log(x)

Decimal Log Function
    - log10(x)


Heron's Formula (area of triangles)
    p = (a+b+c)/2
    s = sqrt(p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c))
