An assertion is a condition that must be true where it is specified.
For example:
    assertion(<condition>);

To use assertions, we must include this library:
    <cassert>

Example:
    p = (a + b + c) / 2;
    assert(p - a > 0);
    assert(p - b > 0);
    assert(p - c > 0);
    area = sqrt(p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c));
