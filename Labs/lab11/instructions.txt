lab 11 - Due 8 December 2025

Write a program that creates a vector of 10 structures called "Pair" having two fields:

ch - for a character
 n - for an integer

initializes the vector with random small characters in the ch field, and random integers
in range [5, 10] in the n field.

Prints the original vector, and sorts the vector with respect to the ch field in the descending
order and prints the storted vector

Sorts the vector in the descending order with respect to the n field, and prints the storted vector


Ex.

sorting wrt ch field
ch        n
c        12
z         9
a         4
p        16

sorting wrt n field
ch        n
p        16
c        12
z         9
a         4
